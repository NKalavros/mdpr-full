# Mutate Dock Predict Repeat (YEAH AS IF THAT IS THE CORRECT ORDER ΣΤΟΥΦΙΔ)
A repository that hosts the necessary scripts to install and run the MDPR routine created by iGEM Athens 2019. Obviously wrongly named.

Just remember to use sed in order to insert your password in the git clone statement in order to be able to download the private repository (no redistribution rights).

Example scripts are commented out.

The proof of concept is performed with human C Reactive Protein (CRP), whose structure is deposited here: http://www.rcsb.org/structure/3L2Y

The aptamer of choice is one found in Aptagen using their apta-index resource. https://www.aptagen.com/aptamer/454/c-reactive-protein and based on this publication. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18066708
