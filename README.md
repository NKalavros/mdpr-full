# Mutate Dock Predict Repeat *YEAH AS IF THAT IS THE CORRECT ORDER ΣΤΟΥΦΙΔ*

A repository that hosts the necessary scripts to install and run the **MPDR** routine created by iGEM Athens 2019. Obviously wrongly named. MPDR stands for Mutate, Predict, Dock Repeat.

## What does this repository contain?

This repository contains scripts to install the necessary programs for the MPDR pipeline. More specifically, those programs are:
1. [ViennaRNA 2.4.14 (RNA secondary structure prediction)](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/),
2. [SimRNA 3.2 (RNA tertiary structure prediction)](http://genesilico.pl/software/stand-alone/simrna),
3. [QRNAS 0.3 (RNA Structure refinement)](http://genesilico.pl/software/stand-alone/qrnas),
4. [HADDOCK 2.2 (Protein RNA docking)](https://haddock.science.uu.nl/),
5. [GROMACS 2019.3 (Molecular Dynamics Simulations)](http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/).

It also contains the files that we used to perform our proof-of-concept attempt of the pipeline for the iGEM Competition. Namely, we have included:

  *[0.fa (RNA aptamer for CRP, taken from Aptagen's Aptaindex)](https://www.aptagen.com/aptamer/454/c-reactive-protein). The RNA aptamer sequence was first discovered in this [publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18066708).
  *[crp.pdb (Human C Reactive Protein structure, taken from the PDB)](http://www.rcsb.org/structure/3L2Y). The protein was crystallised and the results were made public in this [publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jmr.1090?referrer_access_token=sCYf1bjtd5G3z-Fs9O5ynk4keas67K9QMdWULTWMo8NPWaA9ORSiI17d0BpvTifVHxZkwXwvCzEhmceJ7stFO0NuRjCXufzUtqKZ24G6rqaKDHgM0tCLQz3d-BVg64eRPVkHgwVozjfwmMshYhfwRw%3D%3D).
